          <p>
            I'm Ken, a passionate web developer, web designer, and graphic
            designer dedicated to bringing creative visions to life. With a
            strong foundation in both design and development, I craft visually
            compelling and highly functional digital experiences.<br /><br />
            I believe that great design is about more than just looking
            good, it's about solving problems and enhancing interactions. I
            invite you to explore my portfolio and see how my blend of technical
            proficiency and artistic vision can elevate your next project.<br /><br />
            Let's create something extraordinary together!
